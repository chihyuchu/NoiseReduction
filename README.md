# Noise Reduction

This is a simple side-project for noise reduction, just for practices for a classic ISP issue and openCV/C++ coding
For this project, I will keep updating different algorithms about NR, and do some analysis in README.md

Current Algorithm:
1. Gaussian Filter (default opencv function)
2. Bilateral Filter (default opencv function, maybe implement by myself in the future)
3. NL-Means (on-going)
4. BM3D
5. ...
